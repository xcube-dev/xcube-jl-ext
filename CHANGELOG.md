# Changelog

<!-- <START NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->

* Fixed an issue where initialisation of the extension failed due to a missing
  import of the `json` module. Note, this happened only, if the 
  `@jupyterlab/server-proxy` extension has been disabled once.

* Changed occurrences of URL prefix `https://github.com/dcs4cop/` into 
  `https://github.com/xcube-dev/`.
